                <h3>AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE (AIP)</h3>
                <p>A document from a mortgage lender confirming that you will be able to borrow a certain amount. You can use this to prove to a seller that you can afford to buy their property. This document is also often referred to as a Decision in Principle (DIP) and Mortgage in Principle (MIP) which in a nutshell are all the same document just different terminology used.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>APR</h3>
                <p>Annual percentage rate: the overall cost of a mortgage, including the interest and fees. It assumes you will have the mortgage for the whole term, so may not be a useful way to compare deals.</p>

                <h3>ARREARS</h3>
                <p>If you go into arrears, it means you have 'defaulted' at least once on your mortgage repayments, ie you have missed a month's payment. Contact your lender as soon as possible if you think you may go into arrears.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="service-row">
                <h3>BUY TO LET (BTL)</h3>
                <p>A buy-to-let property is bought with the sole intention of letting it to tenants. Most mortgage lenders offer special buy-to-let mortgage deals for this purpose. </p>
            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="service-row ">
                <h3>DEPOSIT</h3>
                <p>This is the amount you are required to put down yourself towards the cost of the property. The minimum deposit you will usually need is 5%, but the cheaper deals are available the larger your deposit becomes.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-row">
                <h3>EARLY REPAYMENT CHARGE (ERC)</h3>

                <h3>EQUITY</h3>
                <p>The amount of the property that you own outright, for example your deposit plus the capital you've paid off on your mortgage. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-row ">
                <h3>EQUITY RELEASE</h3>
                <p>An equity release scheme allows older homeowners to release the cash tied up in their property. There are two types: lifetime mortgages and home-reversion schemes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-row">
                <h3>FIXED RATE MORTGAGE</h3>
                <p>The mortgage interest rate stays the same for the initial period of the deal, which can be anything from 2 to 10 years. This means you can be sure of exactly what you will be paying on your mortgage each month, as your rate won't go up - or down - with the Bank of England base rate. </p>
