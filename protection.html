                <h2> Critical Illness</h2>
                 <p>If you are diagnosed with a critical illness, it can have a severe impact on your finances as you may need to take time off work for your treatment and recovery. Critical illness insurance is designed to help, paying out a lump sum payment when you are diagnosed with one of the specific critical illnesses covered by your policy.</p>

                <h2 > Life Cover</h2>
                <p>Life insurance is a financial product that enables you to leave behind money for your family when you die. This can be used to support them for a number of years, to replace lost income, or to pay off a large debt such as your mortgage. 
                    You pay a monthly premium for life insurance which is dictated by your age, health, lifestyle and how much cover you need, as well as the type of policy you have.</p>

                    <h2> Home Insurance</h2>
                     <p>Buildings insurance covers the cost of repairing damage to the structure of your property. This includes the walls, windows and roof as well as permanent fixtures and fittings such as baths, toilets and fitted kitchens. As a general rule, buildings insurance covers the cost of rebuilding your house from the ground up. It is likely to differ from the market value of your home and often includes the cost of services like demolition, site clearance and architects’ fees.  
                     Depending on the type of policy you choose, you may also be covered for structures around your home like garages, outside walls and driveways. Homeowners often combine this with contents insurance, which protects their belongings from loss, theft or damage.</p>

            <h2> Income Protection</h2>
            <p>Income protection covers you if you're unable to work because of injury or illness. Only a minority of employers support their staff for more than a year if they're off sick from work, and state benefits can be low. Income protection pays a percentage of your earnings until retirement, death or your return to work, though policies with shorter durations are available.</p>
